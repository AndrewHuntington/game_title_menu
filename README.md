# Game Start Screen Menu
A generic intro and start menu I'm just making for fun.
It could be incorporated into an actual project one day.

## Planned Features:
* ~~Company Splash Screen~~
* ~~Menu which consists of:~~
    - ~~Start~~
    - ~~Options~~
    - ~~Exit~~
* Fully working Options section
    - Sound Test
    - Button Config
    - Volume Control
    - Resolution Settings
* Animated Cursor
* Blinking Text When Selected by Cursor
* BGM
* ~~SE (Added to menu screen, not to splash screen yet.)~~
